                    <h2>
                        Failure is inevitable, embrace it!
                    </h2>
                </i>
                <p>
                    This sounds dramatic, but it's also key to keep a healthy mindset while creating art. 
                    Creating and getting better at it is an incredibly slow process - even if you work very efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even so, it's not all lost! There are a couple of things you can do to stay focused, 
                    efficient and most importantly: not burned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Goal folder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most artists not only got into art from the desire to create, but also because they admire certain artworks. 
                    Some artworks more than other, with a selected few long time favourites. Maybe it's not an artist, 
                    but a character you enjoy that much, from your favourite manga, anime or game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a goalfolder you gather all the works you really like - and then start to sort out all the works that 
                    don't quite click with you, like your absolute favourites. Take your time thinking about this folder; 
                    there is no point in rushing it. At the end you want to have a few works left, around a dozen or less, 
                    that give you the feeling of <i>'yes, this is it! I want to draw like this!'</i>. And if you don't quite 
                    get this kind of intense response, just keep pictures you generally like for the time being. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have the goal folder folder set up: Congratulations! You already did the hard part of this task. Now for the legwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try to find what you like about these works. Is it the linework? The choice of colors? Composition? The story? 
                    Maybe it's an emotion you get from the pictures, making you think: <i>'This is epic'</i>, or <i>'This makes me nostalgic'</i>.
                    Both of these are equally important - the emotions as well as the technical aspects of the artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of the goal folder as an ongoing project. You're doing one version now, but as your interest change, or you want to 
                    explore new ideas, it's content also have to change. The purpose is to visualize the direction you want to head in, now. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    A good balance. The 50/50 Rule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very simple rule. But PLEASE pay attention to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not spend more than half the time you do art on practice. At least spend half on personal work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people had fun doodling on a sheet of paper as a child. Drawing, enjoying the process and results 
                    while disregarding any arbitrary standard of quality. But at some point a change occurs. 
                    People stop focussing on the fun. But instead compare the results to their peers or established artists. 
                    And generally putting on the pressure. Driven only by results, not enjoyment of the process. 
                    As such they spent all their time on practice. Trying to master the technical skills before they 
                    even attempt to create something they enjoy. And this might only be the tip of the iceberg that is 
                    the rather hostile elitism that haunts the art community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may not be a surprise, especially looking at the intro line: but focusing only on results isn't healthy. 
                    Especially in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how to fight this?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of ways you can start working on a better mindset. 
                    The first step might be drawing with the intent of not drawing something that looks good. 
                    Setting expectations at a reasonable level. 
                </p>
                <i class="center blue"> 
                    You don't suck, you're just a beginner.
                </i>
                <p>
                    And something important: you can be a beginner and in your 30s. You can be a beginner in your 60s. Being <i>old</i> 
                    doesn't make you any less of a beginner. It's about how much time you spent on a particular skill, not your age. 
                </p>
                <i class="center blue">
                    But I can't catch up with my peers/this random 16 years old/that established artist!
                </i>
                <p>
                    You can. Work diligently and you can improve in a short amount of time. Also, keep in mind you virtually never 
                    know just how much time someone has spent on their craft. It's said it takes 10.000 hours to master a skill. 
                    You can expect most established artists to have put more than that into their craft already. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you spent your 10.000 hours yet? It's a marathon. People will be far ahead if they started running the 
                    race years earlier. Don't overthink that and start running! 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Never looking back...  is not a good idea (in art)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like I mentioned you shouldn't compare yourself (too much) to other people. But who to compare with instead?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is pretty simple: To yourself. From the past. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep a folder somewhere to stash away your practice pieces, personal works, or whatever you're working on. 
                    When you feel stuck (trust me, you will) look through these folders. I can guarantee you: Your work has changed. 
                    And if you were putting in the legwork to improve: You've also improved. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Aside: Beige Art
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Beige. It's likely the most inoffensive color there is. But what is 'beige art' in this context? Of course, it is not refering 
                    to the color itself. Instead it's something that gives you the same emotional response as beige does. None at all. You see it, you forget it. 
                    Some may describe it as formulaic art, or done by the numbers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also why I mentioned the emotional aspect of the work you like. Art that gives an emotional response 
                    creates memories. Don't try to play it safe. Go for the artwork that creates emotions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Any emotion is fine.

                <h2>
                    A holistic approach to Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I touched on this before, but there are a couple main supports that carry the technical side of Art, though mind you - this is 
                    very much based on my opinion which can both be wrong and will most certainly change over time as I learn more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the main supports for art are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Craftsmanship</li>
                    <li>Knowledge</li>
                    <li>Mindset</li>
                </ul>
                To give a small introduction to each. 
                <h4>Craftsmanship</h4>
                <p>
                    In one sentence: your technical ability to create work in line with your vision.
                </p>
                <h4>Knowledge</h4>
                <p>
                    The facts you know about things, these can be certain techniques that feed back into your craftsmanship directly, 
                    or knowledge about mechanics, that help you paint a building that won't fall into itself if you were to build it.
                </p>
                <h4>Mindset</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the least palpable of them all, but also important. It's the state of mind you have while creating. Your 
                    expectations for the results of your art, the importance of certain steps while you're drawing, the one thing 
                    you absolutely hate in the process. Find a way to think about them so you find a good, or at least working 
                    relationship with them. How you think might be as important as what you think. 
                </p>

                    purpose is to make what <i>you</i> want to achieve long term more palpable.
